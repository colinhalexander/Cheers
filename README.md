=======================================================================
Cheers, the CLI app was planned and developed by Amanda Rodgers and Colin Alexander.

Run instructions: 

To run this application you need the following: A text editor similar to VSCode or Atom Ruby and the following Ruby gems: -- gem "activerecord" -- gem "sqlite3" -- gem "sinatra" -- gem "sinatra-activerecord" -- gem "require_all" -- gem "pry" -- gem "rest-client" -- gem "tty-prompt" 

(These will be included within the Gem file once the repo is cloned, if you run into any issues run "bundle install" within your terminal to fix any gem related errors.)

Once the following gems are correctly installed run 'ra' in your terminal in order to fire up the game!
